Update Summary for Current Branch

Overview
This document captures the known modifications in the current working branch, based on the repositoryâ€™s present filesystem and project structure. Due to a terminal timeout in this session, full Git metadata (commit hashes, authors, and exact diffs) could not be enumerated programmatically. The sections below summarize detected changes, affected areas, and recommended verification steps to ensure feature parity post-merge.

Backend Changes
- Migrations added/maintained in backend/migrations:
  - 20250824101444-add-geom-column-to-locations.js
  - 20250828114500-add-profile-image-to-users.js
  - 20250911123000-add-auth-verification-fields-to-users.js
  - 20250911142853-add-auth-columns-to-users.js
  - 20250917120000-add-profile-image-file-id-to-users.js
- Backend runtime: Node + Express + Sequelize present (src/controllers, src/models, src/routes, src/server.ts). Configuration via sequelize-config.js and vercel.json.
- Tests and setup present (jest.config.js, jest.setup.ts).

Frontend Changes
- React app present with TypeScript, Playwright testing, and Netlify deployment support.
- Key folders: src/components, src/pages, src/services, src/utils, src/hooks, setupTests.ts.
- Playwright configuration and report present (playwright.config.ts, playwright-report/index.html).
- Netlify config at frontend/netlify.toml and root netlify.toml; deployment assets in frontend/public and frontend/build.
- Observed search/filter dependency in HomePage.tsx references: issues, searchTerm, searchCategory (ensures list updates when any of these change).

DevOps / Deployment
- Multiple deployment targets detected:
  - Netlify (frontend)
  - Vercel (backend)
  - Render (backend fallback)
- Root-level deployment scripts: deploy-all.js, deploy-backend.js, deploy-frontend.js.

Testing & Verification Plan (Post-Merge)
- Frontend parity checks (main vs dev):
  1) Load homepage, verify core hero text and essential UI routes behave identically (Home, Report Issue, Track Issues).
  2) Validate search/filter behavior (typing search terms and selecting categories updates filtered list consistently).
  3) Confirm no console errors and that network calls succeed.
- Backend parity checks (main vs dev):
  1) Verify status endpoint returns expected JSON structure (status, message, environment, serverless).
  2) Smoke-test key APIs (issue reporting, listing, profile retrieval), checking status codes and response shapes.
- Cross-environment deployment:
  1) Ensure Netlify main deploy completes successfully after merge.
  2) Ensure Vercel and Render deployments are green.

Risk & Rollback
- If parity issues arise post-merge, perform targeted rollback by reverting the merge commit on main or hotfixing via a follow-up PR.
- Keep dev branch untouched to preserve ongoing work.

Follow-up Actions
- Once CI/CD confirms successful deployments, run the parity verification steps. Document results and any discrepancies found.
