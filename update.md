## Impacted Areas
- Backend
  - Authentication flows: email verification, password reset; Sequelize migrations for auth columns and verification fields.
  - Performance: DB pool tuning; retry logic; server health check updates; CORS header fixes.
  - Dependencies: nodemailer and typings; axios updates.
  - Deployments: Vercel/Render config updates; scripts.
- Frontend
  - UI: status-based image filtering, theme handling refactor, map initialization safeguard.
  - Config/Build: Netlify build updates, cross-env, clean build artifacts, GitHub Actions workflows.

## Risk Assessment
- Auth changes require DB migrations; ensure migrations run in production safely.
- Deployment config changes can alter environment variable handling; verify secrets set for each environment.
- Theme and asset updates may affect UI consistency; regression test key views.

## Post-Merge Verification Plan
1) Frontend parity
   - Load homepage, navigate common routes, validate search/filter behavior and images.
   - Ensure no console errors; confirm network calls succeed and data renders identically on both main and dev.
2) Backend parity
   - Health endpoint equality (status/message/environment/serverless).
   - Smoke-test auth endpoints (register, login, email verification, password reset flows), issues CRUD, and CORS.
3) CI/CD
   - Confirm Netlify main deploy completes; Vercel/Render deployments green.

## Rollback Strategy
- If issues arise, revert the merge commit on main or apply hotfix via a follow-up PR; keep dev branch intact.
